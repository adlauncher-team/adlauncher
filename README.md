# ADLAUNCHER | MINECRAFT LAUNCHER WITH ELECTRON AND ADLAUNCHER-CORE

ADLauncher is a Minecraft launcher with a graphical interface created using Electron and ADLauncher-core.

This project has been carried out with the aim of providing a way to play Minecraft for free without using launchers that may contain viruses in your system.

This is the first version of the launcher and it will be updated over time, adding new features, fixing bugs, and accepting community suggestions.

Its usage is simple, and the interface is designed to be user-friendly for all audiences.

Remember that we do not support video game piracy. Support their original creators and whenever you can, purchase the original video game without a second thought.

## Usage

### Installation

To download the launcher, go to [Downloads](https://github.com/dani-adbg/adlauncher/releases) and choose the file you need.

If you don't want to use the installer, download the `.zip` file and extract it wherever you want.

If the program doesn't find `Java`, it will download it automatically when started for the first time.

### Download Version

Navigate to the `Download Version` tab and type in the version you want to download.

### Play

To play, simply click the `Play` button. The program will minimize, and the selected version of Minecraft will start running.

### Change Settings

You can go to the `Settings` tab to change certain settings, such as the Minecraft folder to be used and the amount of RAM to be allocated (remember not to select invalid values).

Then, click the button to save the settings.
